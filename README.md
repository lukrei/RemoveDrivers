I just created a Remove Monitor Object Script for Gameguard AC. Just in Case if you Monitor in Gameguard gets banned just create the Batch Script and adapt it to your Monitor Device instance path in Device Manager.
And create a Scheduled Task with Priviledged Access and let it run when a user logs on.

Gameguard then won't ban you...
