I just created a Remove Monitor Object Script for Gameguard AC. Just in case if your Monitor Serial gets you banned just create the Batch Script and adapt it to your Monitor Device instance path in Device Manager.
And create a Scheduled Task with Priviledged Access and let it run when a user logs on.

Gameguard then won't ban you... at least not for using your old monitor.
